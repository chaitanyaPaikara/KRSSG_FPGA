Analyzing top module <main>.
WARNING:Xst:905 - "main.v" line 34: One or more signals are missing in the sensitivity list of always block. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:
   <x>
Module <main> is correct for synthesis.

WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <ce> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 15-bit latch for signal <rpm>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
WARNING:Xst:643 - "main.v" line 37: The result of a 15x15-bit multiplication is partially used. Only the 15 least significant bits are used. If you are doing this on purpose, you may safely ignore this warning. Otherwise, make sure you are not losing information, leading to unexpected circuit behavior.
